the code herein builds a multiple choice answering system, training
on the social iqa [1] dataset for learning commonsense reasoning,
using the hugging face and pytorch libraries.

the system is a fine-tuned encoder of unified qa [2]. my approach is
to treat this task a binary classification problem, where given
a question, context, and one potential condidate answer, the model
estimates the probability that the given candidate is actually the
answer or not. 

    p(a | q, c) ∈ [0, 1]

we thus run each candidate answer one at a time (this can be
parallelized) along with the question and context, get the raw
logits of each, and then perform a softmax and treat the argmax
as the ansswer to the question.

    argmax(softmax( p(a | q, c)), ∀a: candidate_answer(a) = T

models.py:
    this module holds class FinetunedQA, which defines our approach
    described above. this code is not meant to be run directly.

data_processing.py:
    this module holds class SocialIQA which is reponsible for
    processing, formatting social iqa data, with additional
    functionality. this script is also not meant to be run directly.

build.py:
    this module demostrate how to use both modules above to fine-
    tune the encoder component of unified qa. this script is meant
    to be run directly, it accepts no command line argumetns, just
    simply cd into the folder containing these files and do.

        >>> python build.py

data:
    this is a folder containing the relevant data, housing json
    files:
        dev
        test
        train
    each entry holds context, question, and candidate answer fields.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

this code was made with the intention to be well formated, documented
and thus relatively easy to follow. have fun!
